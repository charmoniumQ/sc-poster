\begin{block}{Compiled Query Processing~\cite{SK16,N11}}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item DB engine is specialized for a particular query
    \item Can be pre-compiled or JIT-compiled
      \begin{itemize}
      \item Smaller code $\implies$ less i-cache misses and branches
      \item Specialized data structures
      \item Combine code for multiple operators (pipeline) $\implies$ optimizations within operators and less func calls
      \item Specialize code for hardware without blow up in code size
      \end{itemize}
    \item The DB-programmer writes compiled code in the unikernel, giving them unfettered access HW.
      \begin{itemize}
      \item Compose operators within a block $\implies$ avoid function-call overhead.
      \item Control HW $\implies$ NUMA-aware code.
      \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
