  \begin{itemize}

  \item Specialization allows us to beat Linux with relatively little effort.

  \item We should be able to beat Linux everywhere
    \begin{itemize}
    \item By switching to Linux's algorithm when the workload is suited to it
    \end{itemize}
    
    % just details:
    % \item Specialization significantly improves cache performance, and this sometimes translates to reducing overall runtime.
    % \item Compiled queries that consist of highly-specialized code benefit from a hybrid runtime environment

  \item Hybrid runtimes have more predictable performance than general purpose OS
    \begin{itemize}
    \item will lead to better performance once we go parallel (e.g., bulk-synchronous model)
    \end{itemize}
