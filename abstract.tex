\begin{block}{Abstract}
  With the explosion of ``big data'', executing queries on vast amounts of data in parallel has become a bottleneck in many HPC systems.
  Complex towers of abstractions behind generic interfaces in the traditional software stack are getting in the way of better performance from multi-core systems.

  To mitigate this inefficiency, we built hybrid runtime kernel (based on the Nautilus Aerokernel) for the paralel execution compiled queries.
  We evaluate the performance of our specialized runtime against a general-purpose runtime, for which Linux will serve as our examplar.
