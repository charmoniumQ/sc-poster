  \textbf{Goal: to integrate specialization techniques from the OS
    community \buzzword{hybrid runtimes} and DB community
    \buzzword{compiled queries} for high-performance query
    processing.}
\end{overviewbox}

  \begin{itemize}

  \item Executing queries on \buzzword{big data} takes long.

  \item Certain abstractions improve generality, but get in the way of
    performance.

    % Complex multi-layered abstractions behind generic interfaces in
    % the traditional OS and database software stack are getting in
    % the way of exploiting the characteristics of modern multi-core
    % systems to maximize performance.

  \item We prototype \buzzword{NautDB}: specialized using a
    \buzzword{hybrid runtime kernel} (based on the \buzzword{Nautilus
      Aerokernel}~\cite{HALE:2015:NAUTILUS}) and executing
    pre-compiled building-blocks.

    % for the parallel execution of \buzzword{compiled queries}, thus,
    % combining for the first time the concepts of hybrid runtimes and
    % compiled query processing developed by the operating system and
    % database communities.

  \item We demonstrate performance benefits in certain cases, while
    maintaining a simple interface for users.
