\begin{block}{Motivation}

  The goal of this research is to integrate the improvements
  specialized systems (unikernels) with the improvements in
  specialized DB (compiled queries) to achieve high-performance.

  \begin{itemize}
  \item Status quo
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Too many abstractions makes high-performance difficult.
    \item OS is not aware of the workload; app-programmer is.
    \item DB systems already have specialized scheduling abstraction, mem. management abstraction.
    \item \alert{Give up the flexibility and generality in exchange for performance.}
    \end{itemize}

  \item Specialized Hybrid Runtime
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Kernel + Dataflow Runtime run in ring 0 (unikernel-like).
    \item Advances in multi-kernel environments allow physical \todo{(cite pisces)} resources to be split between a full-weight kernel and our specialized runtime.
      % \item \alert{Unikernel-inspired design prevents the OS from `getting in the way' of the app-programmer.}
    \item {Unikernel-inspired design allows the app-programmer fine-grained control over the execution environment.}
      \begin{itemize}
      \item Control over scheduling $\implies$ no context-switches.
      \item Control over OS $\implies$ avoid interrupts $\implies$ faster and more predictable.
      \item No virtual memory $\implies$ huge page-sizes (1Gb) $\implies$ no TLB misses.
      \item Control over memory $\implies$ specialize memory-allocator for workload (by app-programmer). See Fig \ref{fig:1}
      \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}

  \item Compiled Queries
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Could be pre-compiled or JIT-compiled.
    \item {The app-programmer writes compiled code in the unikernel, giving them unfettered access HW.}
      \begin{itemize}
      \item Compose operators within a block $\implies$ avoid function-call overhead.
      \item Control HW $\implies$ NUMA-aware code.
      \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}

  \end{itemize}
