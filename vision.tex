\begin{block}{Our Vision: \textbf{NautDB}}

  Implement our vision of \textit{NautDB} as a hybrid dataflow engine
  for compiled queries

  \begin{itemize}

  \item \textbf{VMs}: Since NautDB is an application-specific OS, it
    could be running in its own VM alongisde a general-purpose OS.

  \item \textbf{Frontend}: compiles queries into executable tasks for
    the dataflow backend and takes care of higher-level scheduling and
    runtime optimization tasks (e.g., task placement and global
    planning)

  \item \textbf{Threads}: will be pinned to CPU cores; they will run
    to completion without interruption.

  \item \textbf{Work distribution}: Cores are either workers that pull
    tasks from a local (lock-free) queue and execute them or
    management threads that pass tasks from clients to workers and
    hand results to clients, push statistics about task execution and
    resource utilization to clients, and garbage collect task memory.

  \end{itemize}
