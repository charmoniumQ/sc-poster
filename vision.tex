\begin{block}{Our Vision: \textbf{NautDB}}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{NautDB}: Implement our vision of \textit{NautDB} as a
    hybrid dataflow engine for compiled queries
  \item \textbf{Architecture}: We envision the system to consist of two major components:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Frontend}: The purpose of the frontend is to handle communication with the clients of the system, to compile queries into executable tasks for the dataflow backend, and to take care of higher-level scheduling and runtime optimization tasks
    \item \textbf{Hybrid Dataflow Runtime for Compiled Code}: The hybrid dataflow runtime will benefit from a simple design: threads will be pinned to CPU cores and each core is either a worker that pulls tasks from a local (lock-free) queue and executes them or a management thread that passes tasks from clients to workers and hands results to clients, pushes statistics about task execution and resource utilization to clients, and garbage collects data generated by tasks.
