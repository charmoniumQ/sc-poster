For larger number of columns and chunk sizes, Nautilus outperforms Linux. This is because Nautilus has larger page size and incurs less TLB misses (see Table \ref{table:cache_miss}).

Nautilus performance is more predictable than Linux, even when its raw performance is worse. Nautilus does not have scheduling interrupts, so it avoids unpredictable detours which also leads to better cache performance (see Table \ref{table:cache_miss-col}).

    Linux              & 2,500,000 & 8,200,000 \\
    Nautilus           &         1 & 1,100,000 \\
