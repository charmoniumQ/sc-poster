  \begin{itemize}
      \item Customized OS support for data-processing~\cite{GICEVA:2016:OS_SUPPORT}: \todo{I am not sure what specific improvements we have over this paper.}
      \item A Case for Transforming Parallel Runtimes Into Operating System Kernels~\cite{HALE:2015:NAUTILUS}: the authors use a specialized runtime and show performance benefit for runtimes such as Legion.
      \item System-Level Support for Composition of Applications~\cite{KOCOLOSKI:2015:PISCES}: the authors introduce Pisces which allows multiple kernels to run on the same physical node, partitioning the resources. This makes it more convenient to run an single-application OS alongside a general-purpose OS for other applicatoins.
  \item Query compilation~\cite{SK16,N11} allows database engine code to be fine-tuned for individual queries
