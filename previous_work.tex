  \begin{itemize}
  \item Customized OS support for data-processing: \todo{I am not sure what specific improvements we have over this paper.}
  \item A Case for Transforming Parallel Runtimes Into Operating System Kernels: the authors use a specialized runtime and show performance benefit for runtimes such as Legion.
  \item System-Level Support for Composition of Applications: the authors introduce Pisces which allows multiple kernels to run on the same physical node, partitioning the resources. This makes it more convenient to run an single-application OS alongside a general-purpose OS for other applicatoins.
  \item \todo{get a paper on Compiled Queries}
